As this game was only really used to satisfy the requirements of my class's homework assignments, it is not meant to be seen as a complete "game," but rather a
sandbox/workspace I could use to familiarize myself with Unity concepts whilst also satisfying each homework assignment's requirements.

There is no real "objective" other than perhaps collecting all the coins on screen while avoiding monsters that one-shot you. There is a start screen and a death
screen, but no victory screen. You can move with the wasd keys or the arrow keys, and you can mute the music at any time with the "m" key. Right-clicking the mouse
initiates a punch attack, but it doesn't really *do* anything.
